#Salesman
Optimizes a path for a travelling salesman through iterative refinement

This program reads in the coordinates of cities in the 2D plane to which a salesman has to travel.  The salesman visits every city once and only once before returning to his start location, and it seeks to find the best route for him to travel through iteratively refining the route for a one.  This program will read in the fifty cities, naming them with a number in the order they were read (e.g. City 0, City 1, City 2, etc.), and prints out both the total travel distance and the path he should take.
